This project will hold backend code used to connect with database and generation of pdf with other logical processes. The previous repo/project cv_generator was fullstack nodejs app mongodb used as database storage and handlebar for rendering frontend ui components. But in this repo I changed two things. Firstly, the database is changed to sqlite for the sake of simplicity, speed and price consideration. Secondly, the frontend is changed to reactjs rather than handlebar rendering tool for the purpose of effeciency, speed and practice.
